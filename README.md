# Building with Terraform Course
This is a course that I created to teach folks how to use Terraform. It's absolutely free and by the end of the course you'll have the confidence and understanding needed to build AWS resources via code using Terraform.

I plan to continue adding content overtime and will also be creating follow along videos on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@techwithtyler/).
